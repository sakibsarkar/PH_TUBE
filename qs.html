    <h1><i>Q1. </i>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const </h1>
    <h2>Ans :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Var :</span> "var" declaration are global scoped, means we can access the variable from anywhere & var declared
                variables can be updated and redeclared <br>
                Example :If a variable is declared with "var" inside a function, the variable will be accessible both
                inside and outside the function</h3>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Let :</span> "let" is a keyword introduced in ES6 used to declare a block scoped variable. Blocked scoped
                variables are limited to the block in which they are defined (Usually denoted by curly braces {}) <br>
                Example : if we declared a variable inside a loop, then the variable is not accessable ouside the loop
            </h3>
            <img src="./images/code2.png" alt="" srcset="">
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Const :</span> A variable declared with "const" is also a block scoped variable just like "let". Const was also
                introduced in ES6. But const has a slight deferent, the value of "const" variable cannot be updated.
                <br>
                Example : const x = 10; <br>
                after declaring the variable "x" with "const" ,we can't change the value of "x" <br>
                if we try to do this x = 18 or x = x + 1 <br>
                it will give us an error in our code
            </h3>

    </ol>


    <h1><i>Q2. </i>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3><span>Undefined:</span>  Undefined is basically used for when we are trying to uninitialized variables, missing function
                arguments, and when trying to access nonexistent object properties</h3>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3><span>Null:</span> "null" is used to represent the absence of a value. It can also be used in comparisons to check for the absence of a value in a object.</h3>
        </li>
    </ol>
